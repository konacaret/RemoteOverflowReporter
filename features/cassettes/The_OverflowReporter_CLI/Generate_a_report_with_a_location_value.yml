        Engineer at Keen IO (San Francisco, CA) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage
        Engineer at Keen IO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen IO is
        seeking engineers to join our Platform team. &amp;nbsp;We build and nurture
        an Analytics API that processes user data and queries around the clock, across
        diverse industries. &amp;nbsp;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s gaming, e-commerce, advertising,
        publishing, or IoT, our platform makes analytics easy for developers so they
        can focus entirely on their core product. &amp;nbsp;Every day, every week,
        every month our challenge is to scale with a constantly growing data deluge
        and evolve along with our user&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About
        the Platform Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hail from
        diverse backgrounds. Many of us followed non-traditional paths. &amp;nbsp;Our
        current platform is built using Python, Scala and Java, and on top of Tornado,
        Kafka, Storm, Cassandra, Zookeeper, Vagrant and more. If you have lots of
        war stories, we&amp;rsquo;re eager to learn from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
        work together in a pretty novel fashion - servant leaders are elected from
        the team, by the team. Responsibilities normally held by a single manager
        are separated across multiple roles. We have very open discussions about our
        shared priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always iterating
        on how we work and what we build. We&amp;rsquo;re growing fast and we know
        that what worked a year ago won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily work a year from now.
        This applies both to the technology and the organizations of our teams. We
        want to provide the best analytics experience for developers and co-create
        the best work environment for each other - willingness to evolve is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By
        centralizing a data pipeline for hundreds of companies, we operate at a scale
        that none of them have to worry about. Looking to the horizon, we need to
        look at every piece of our infrastructure with a critical eye. &amp;nbsp;We
        need to stay ahead of the curve. &amp;nbsp;You will help us be thoughtful
        and deliberate about tackling the right bottlenecks at the right time. &amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;ll
        help make working on the platform easier and easier. &amp;nbsp;Most importantly,
        you&amp;rsquo;ll collaborate with some pretty amazing humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be
        responsible for the storage and management of a large and growing event dataset&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design and implement improved database and system level monitoring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote knowledge sharing around storage and databases within
        the company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying capacity and managing production events should be
        easy and predictable. &amp;nbsp;Building solid automation makes sure this
        is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a passion for working with
        distributed databases at scale&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar

        Engineer full-stack developer who will work with our design and development
        teams in building frontend applications, tools and content management systems
        focused on ReactJS, Angular and the NodeJS and express stacks Candidates should
        be expert JavaScript developers comfortable with advanced JavaScript concepts.
        Day to day responsibilities will be as primary developer and technical lead
        on either React, Angular or NodeJS content management tools and projects.
        Ideal candidates should be able to architect and build large scale, JavaScript
        applications based on standard frontend Javascript tools and libraries and
        comfortable using build tools such as gulp, grunt, requirejs, or browserify.
        Some of our most recent applications have been written in ES6 using gulp,
        babel and browserify. As we expand as a team we are also adding automated
        testing to many of our tools and projects using tools such as Cucumber and
        Karma so experience with JavaScript BDD/TDD tools is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates should also be comfortable with other front-end web
        technologies and tools such as HTML, CSS and tooling such as SASS or LESS
        (we use SASS mostly)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a client facing

        We are looking for folks comfortable across a variety of languages, platforms
        and frameworks, and can code, and get things done regardless of language.
        Our primary development work is done in JavaScript however we frequently need
        to build quick and dirty tools for our clients to host, or their existing
        CMS (Drupal a lot) so PHP is frequently used however we also have an affinity
        for frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, and NodeJS/Express when we can choose
        the full stack. Our projects generally are 3-6 month development projects
        and we maintain internal tools and frameworks to ease and speed development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are an interactive agency, who design and build bespoke applications
        for our clients. Unfortunately this frequently forces us into more of a "Waterfall"
        development methodology. We''re trying to address this by using Agile and
        iterative methodologies as much as possible. From a management perspective
        we''re looking for folks who have experience with using and adapting agile
        practices to less than agile projects so we''re looking for candidates familiar
        with agile processes but able to adapt to our project realities.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat,

        when we can choose the full stack. &amp;nbsp;Our projects generally are 3-6
        month development projects and we maintain internal tools and frameworks to
        ease and speed development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are
        an interactive agency which means we build applications for our clients. Unfortunately
        this frequently forces us into more of a "Waterfall" development methodology.
        We''re trying to address this by using Agile and iterative methodologies as
        much as possible. From a management perspective we''re looking for folks who
        have experience with using and adapating agile practices to less than agile
        projects so we''re looking for candidates familiar with agile processes but
        able to adapt to our project realties.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat,

        customer base is growing quickly, and we want your combination of sharp technical
        and warm people skills to help our customers solve problems and get the most
        out of their databases at Compose. We operate a fleet of various databases,
        so there is something for everyone: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch,
        RethinkDB, and likely many more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are
        a developer, DevOps/SRE magician, or database junkie and know how to help
        developers with technical questions, we want to talk to you. You will be most
        effective if you have an inquisitive nature, are technically-inclined and
        love to learn. We are not just looking to fight fires, we are looking to prevent
        them. We pride ourselves in providing top-notch support and guidance, so being
        able to communicate effectively with empathy and compassion is a must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the perfect position for a motivated learner who wants
        to gain experience within a vibrant team focused on building an intuitive
        and customer-focused product. Spending time with our customers and product
        will let you interact with all sorts of interesting characters and will help
        you grow into a high-end distributed systems engineering position (we need
        those too, so if you start on support and do a great job, there is a huge
        amount of room for growth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We''re a distributed
        team and we work across many different time zones. If you''re a night owl,
        an early riser, or somewhere in between, we''re happy to accommodate untraditional
        work schedules -- our worldwide customers often need help at odd hours!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compose implements blind-hiring! Merit based, objectively graded
        work samples are the first step. We have worked hard to minimize our own biases
        as much as possible and find the best possible humans for the team. We respect
        a fancy education or a list of spectacular previous accomplishments, but nothing
        is more impressive than the right combination of ingredients - which you can
        objectively demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any time during
        the process, we are available to chat (email, video, whatever you like) to
        ensure you are comfortable with the process and feel that you''re being treated
        fairly and with respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look forward to
        meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note: At this

        Data Science Engineer (US Based) at AdRoll (San Francisco, CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The
        Data Science Engineering team writes the math and software that sit at the
        heart of AdRoll&amp;rsquo;s real-time bidding technology, our core product.
        &amp;nbsp;Our software runs over hundreds of terabytes of data daily to produce
        its models, which are then subsequently queried billions of times by hundreds
        of servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current members of Data Science
        Engineering have a passion for not only mathematics, but also technology.
        If you join our team, you will have the opportunity to stay on the cutting
        edge of research and then to put this research to practical use by building
        your own software and infrastructure systems. When you push out your code,
        you will be able to see the results of your efforts ripple throughout our
        systems in real-time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, AdRoll Engineering is broken
        out into small teams that have significant autonomy. We like to think of Data
        Science Engineering as a "startup within AdRoll." You will design your systems
        as you see fit, own your code, and your work will have a very direct, measurable
        impact on AdRoll''s core metrics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the
        Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data Science Engineering is a small
        team with a variety of concurrent projects. Your interests dictate what projects
        you will tackle. The common thread among all projects is that they require
        a high level of mathematical sophistication and engineering prowess, due to
        the scale of our data. Current projects include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhancing our machine learning software
        with the latest in machine learning algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employing
        machine learning and statistical modeling over our petabytes of data to generate
        new features to feed into our bid-time predictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating
        systems that monitor inputs and performance on a real-time basis to inform

        role, working with a small team of engineers and users from various backgrounds.
        You will be expected to wear many hats. &amp;nbsp;This will include, but is
        not limited to, owning and improving our Python based distributed ML model
        building system, building and improving our Java based backend services, building
        and improving our cloud management system and developing pieces of our next
        generation user interface. &amp;nbsp;We have been developing this platform
        for more than 10 years, so the large, complex codebase requires regular maintenance
        at all layers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our
        Technology Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At
        the base of our stack is a proprietary distributed computational platform,
        which allows us to process many millions of virtual molecules at scale. We
        typically host this platform on Amazon Web Services infrastructure, where
        we often parallelize our computations across more than 10,000 cores. At the
        next layer of our stack are custom services and libraries, such as machine
        learning, cheminformatics and bioinformatics. At the very top of our stack
        sits a number of user-facing tools, including web-based GUIs, *NIX command
        line tools, and custom plugins for third party data analysis and chemistry
        tools. All of the layers use various storage types (MySQL, S3, Cassandra,
        Couchbase, custom built). The code base is mostly written in Java and Python.
        All of these layers are being actively developed and improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our software is used by our in-house scientists
        and industry partners. The demands on our software are very high, so we employ
        current best practices for development, such as continuous integration, unit
        and performance testing, agile/scrum methodologies, code reviews, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Engineer - Pivotal Cloud Foundry at Pivotal Cloud Foundry (San Francisco,
        CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Foundry engineering team is looking
        for a few great engineers to join us in building an open source platform that
        transforms how the world deploys and scales software.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You
        love shipping features, but know that well factored code is what lets you
        keep shipping features in the long run.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you get antsy writing
        code without tests, or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re a large-scale system operator
        interested in leveling-up your coding skills.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Either
        way, you judge your success by the success of your team; you are interested
        in learning about distributed systems; and you are excited to work on open
        source.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;At
        Cloud Foundry we are opinionated about how software should be built. We pair
        program, all-day every-day, because we know it delivers remarkable results.
        We work in small teams, and rotate between them frequently. We believe in
        working at a sustainable pace &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll typically code
        hard for 8 hours each day, but then you&amp;rsquo;re off work to relax, recharge,
        and refocus.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Cloud
        Foundry engineering is located in San Francisco, in our SOMA office near 4th
        and Howard St.&amp;nbsp; To make sure you start your day energized, we provide
        a catered breakfast every weekday morning, and unlimited snacks/drinks are
        of course available all day. Our collaborative, open-plan office space is
        filled with talented, like-minded engineers who enjoy taking advantage of
        our weekly Tech Talks, playing ping pong, and hanging out with their co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue,

        Manager at Rally Health, Inc. (San Francisco, CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Rally
        Health improves health and saves money with our friendly, easy-to-use products
        that help people improve their diet and fitness, shop for health benefits,
        and find the best doctor at the right price for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do it at scale, with millions of reachable accounts and thousands
        of concurrent users, figures which are roughly doubling every year. The Operations
        team drives&amp;nbsp;the systems that power this growth in a stable, secure,
        and performant way, and we are looking for YOU to join and lead our team in
        San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be a hands-on manager,
        setting career goals with team members and using metrics to assess overall
        team health. We are a high-touch, collaborative team, and you will be expected
        be an aggressive steward of the culture, providing room for individuals to
        take risks and sometimes fail while not compromising the integrity or availability
        of our systems. "Firm but fair" is sort of corny but that''s what you will
        be. You''ll be courageous too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This position
        is in our San Francisco office in SOMA, but the team is distributed, with
        presence in all the lower-48 timezones. The ideal candidate will have management
        experience in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our technology
        stack is modern and always changing, but we are thoughtful and deliberate
        about bringing new technologies. Currently most of our services are fat-JAR
        Scala deployments to Chef-configured&amp;nbsp;Ubuntu''s that end up directly
        on AWS or on Mesos, with lots of RabbitMQ traffic between them, backed by
        MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Postgres, and you should be comfortable in that sort
        of environment, using Python to automate everything you can. Or Ruby if you
        have to.&amp;nbsp;Where we can, we make decisions based on data, and the ideal
        candidate would know how to use tools such as Librato and Splunk to get a
        global understanding of the system but also be able to get down and dirty
        in the shell on individual machines. On-call rotation is part of the role,
        as you might expect, but we work hard to make that not suck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we manage health-care data, we must comply with HIPAA
        and related laws, and good decision-making and data-defensive thinking are
        critical for our team members.&amp;nbsp;We are especially interested in candidates
        who have DBA experience with a relational or NoSQL database and/or who have
        worked in a HITRUST-guided or regulated environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our
        culture is important to us and we cultivate it carefully. We do not strive
        for heroism and while we recognize and reward individual accomplishments,
        we know that ultimately, teams win. Most of our projects are paired work and
        several of our team members are embedded in development teams.&amp;nbsp;I
        almost wrote this whole job posting without saying DevOps. Oh well! Yeah,
        we do that too, whatever it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
        addition to a typical startup benefit package, we offer free health care for
        individuals (families prorated and highly discounted), catered lunches every
        day and snacks, unlimited PTO, and competitive compensation including stock
        options.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 17:28:43 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-03-08T17:28:43Z</a10:updated><location

        the leader of the IDenTV DevOps team, there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to the impact
        you can have on the business. All of our engineering teams are responsible
        for deploying and supporting their own services, and because of this they
        look to us for advice, guidance, and stability. We invest heavily in infrastructure
        because we know that engineers are happiest when they&amp;rsquo;re shipping
        code. Our current MVP deployment has been deemed in the top 10% of ALL Open-Stack
        deployments in 2015 and we have plans to expand and ASAP!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
        We believe in picking the right tools for the job, whether that means evaluating
        the current networking, third party vendors or preparing schematics for colocation
        and building something in house. We aren&amp;rsquo;t dogmatic about technologies
        and we adapt our systems based on the needs of the organization. Currently
        you&amp;rsquo;ll find us writing Python and using a suite of Amazon Web Services,
        Jenkins, Splunk, Docker, and Graphite, just to name a few.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a FAMILY business with FAMILY values and although we
        want to trust all humanity we have had a few bad apples, however if you show
        the loyalty and commitment your growth can be unlimited - this would be entering
        a high impact team from the 1st floor of the proverbial ground floor of the
        Company (work to become core team member and long-term can build to earn options
        and more!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;**WE WILL CONSIDER REMOTE WORK IF

        Network Administrator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar&amp;rsquo;s Network &amp;amp; Server Admin group is a
        small team of Systems Administrators who are responsible for all aspects of
        the studio&amp;rsquo;s network, server and core infrastructure. We work tirelessly
        behind the scenes to ensure that all systems and services the Studio relies
        on to create our movies are fully operational with ample room to grow. From
        DNS to NTP to BGP (we really know our TLAs!), we are constantly looking for
        new ways to stay ahead of the curve. We are looking for someone to join our
        team as a network-centric Senior Network/Sysadmin who is nimble, has a positive
        attitude, and works well as part of a small team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar
        is a dynamic, fast-paced environment and our group thrives on creative thinking,
        independent initiative, and close collaboration. We interface primarily with
        other groups within the Systems Department, and the Studio Tools Department,
        building everything from physical servers to virtual machines to racks to
        cloud services. We are always looking for new ways to automate processes and
        make optimal use of the myriad of data sources flowing from our systems and
        networks. A given problem might entail writing Python or shell scripts, digging
        into a vendor&amp;rsquo;s API documentation, or trawling through an SNMP MIB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the stuff we work with every day, in no particular order:
        Linux/UNIX, DNS, DHCP, Firewalls, AAA servers, Mail servers/appliances, load
        balancers, routers, switches, wireless LANs, WAN connectivity, and fiber optic
        networking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 01:35:21 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-03-03T01:35:21Z</a10:updated><location

        interaction features like whispers. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who
        brings JavaScript application development experience and technical leadership
        around whom we can build a focused team to execute on one of the core product
        areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will work closely with both technical and
        product teams at Twitch, and be responsible for gathering requirements and
        executing on the technical direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web client
        is written with Ember.js, builds using Ember CLI, uses ES6 features via Babel,
        and manifests backend systems like chat and video as user-facing products.&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll write a lot of code, but you&amp;rsquo;ll
        also mentor engineers around you and do whatever needs to be done for the

        Research is looking for backend developer with deep understanding of operating
        systems, networks and taste for simple and efficient architectural designs.
        Our backend is implemented mostly in OCaml and some C++, as such proficiency
        in OCaml is very much appreciated, otherwise a strong inclination to intensively
        learn OCaml in a short term will be required. Understanding of functional
        programming in general and/or experience with other FP languages (F#,Haskell,Scala,Scheme,etc)
        will help a lot. Knowledge of C++ is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The
        ideal candidate is expected to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Independently
        deal with and investigate bugs, schedule tasks and dig code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make argumented technical choice and take responsibility for
        it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the whole technology stack at
        all levels : from network and userspace code to OS internals and hardware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handle full development cycle of a single component, i.e. formalize
        task, write code and tests, setup and support production (devops)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approach problems with practical mindset and suppress perfectionism
        when time is a priority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These
        requirements stem naturally from our approach to development with fast feedback
        cycle, highly-focused personal areas of responsibility and strong tendency
        to vertical component splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Feb

        we produce huge amounts of data, and you will find the insights to make it
        actionable. You will have broad impact and exposure across Grammarly, working
        with team members from our product, research, marketing, engineering, and

        user behavior and feature usage across Grammarly&amp;rsquo;s products. Find
        patterns and make suggestions to improve user experience and acquisition (e.g.,
        discover which users are most likely to refer Grammarly to a friend).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build and publish self-serve dashboards so all functions at
        Grammarly have access to the most relevant metrics and can make the best decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with the data engineering team to expand data coverage,
        compute new metrics, and continually improve the quality of data collection
        and analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advocate and champion data-driven
        approaches across the organization. You will accomplish this through presentations,
        in one-on-one discussions, and above all else, by providing excellent data
        services to the different teams. Your goal is to empower each and every Grammarly

        a senior full stack developer on the Customer Engagement team, you will lead
        projects designed to reinvent an essential part of the home-buying process:
        how customers visit homes. Whether by leveraging Google&amp;rsquo;s APIs to
        make smarter decisions about which of our real estate agents can take a customer
        on tour or enabling instant confirmations of tour times, our mission is to
        provide choices when customers want them, enable flexibility when our agents
        need it, and automate the rest. Our Book It Now feature was recognized as
        the Most Innovative Real Estate Technology by the 2015 Inman Innovator Awards,
        and we&amp;rsquo;re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About
        you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a senior developer with 5+ years of experience developing
        large scale Java apps backed by relational databases - we use Java, Spring,
        Hibernate, and Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You keep up with the ever-changing landscape of JavaScript innovation,
        and can speak to the benefits of ES6, Node, or React.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You prefer to use pre-built technologies
        from proven companies like Google and Twilio, but you know when it&amp;rsquo;s
        time to build a tailored solution from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re excited to reduce a process
        that takes multiple phone calls, spreadsheets, and calendars to a single click
        - you constantly wonder about how to make things smarter and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a teacher
        and a mentor: you have the leadership skills (and the patience) to improve
        the developers around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you disagree, you disagree constructively, with respect
        for everyone else''s opinions and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything, you share a passion
        for our mission to radically change the way people make one of the biggest
        decisions of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br

        consumer and enterprise web and mobile applications for global clients, and
        have a growing practice building applications for the iOS and Android platforms.
        We also developed Pivotal Tracker, the project management and collaboration

        We practice and teach an approach to software engineering that applies across
        industries and organizations, so you&amp;rsquo;ll experience all types of
        teams, products, and technologies. And we believe in working at a sustainable
        pace &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll typically code hard for 8 hours each day,

        improve on it. We consistently practice Test Driven Development, which results

        Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good

        multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design

        are a technology consulting company that provides security architecture, infrastructure

        in the pipeline under other brands. Our goal is to provide robust and secure
        environments for businesses with an internet presence.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
        We are currently hiring two Level 1 Security Engineers, one from a development
        background and one from a systems background. We offer health insurance, retirement
        fund, an office in your local city with other people like you, and flexible
        working conditions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Currently the company provides automation,
        devops, and security services, and the security part of the business is undergoing
        expansion. Initially you will be doing a combination of 2nd level application
        support, devops and automation work, while increasing your skills in defensive
        and offensive security. After 2 years we expect this role to develop into
        a qualified security consultant, holding at least one mid level security certification.
        &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Much internal technical training is done via a Capture
        the Flag rather than a rote learning model, meaning you''re given a set of
        tasks and are required to find or build a solution with some hints. However
        documenting, recording, and knowledge sharing are still critical.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt; This is a remote work position with occasional interstate travel
        so you''ll need to have excellent time management and self-management skills.
        We will provide access to a local co-working environment in order to maximize
        your success.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2016 16:39:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-02-23T16:39:48Z</a10:updated><location

        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of our communications teams you will implement real-time
        voice and messaging services. &amp;nbsp;To take it to scale, you will be developing
        a complex distributed platform with points of presence globally and will be
        concerned with availability, throughput, latency, media fidelity as well as
        real-time considerations. There will be a significant data component so you
        will be working with distributed SQL and NoSQL databases and caches. &amp;nbsp;At
        the core are cloud technologies that enable deployment and management of computing
        resources globally. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br

        and Engineering leaders to define, architect and build new customer-facing
        features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Own, operate, and maintain your
        team&amp;rsquo;s services in a distributed production environment. Employ
        Agile methodologies to continuously deliver value to customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive quality by writing unit, functional, load and performance
        tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work closely with DevOps engineers
        to ensure services are reliable, scalable, manageable and supportable. &amp;nbsp;Develop
        diagnostic and troubleshooting tools made available via our developer portal
        and to our customer support organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excel
        as an engineer and be a productive member of the team where leadership is
        a behavioral trait, not a title. &amp;nbsp;Lead architecture, design and code
        reviews as well as mentor junior engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon,

        the Job:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be responsible
        for designing, developing and&amp;nbsp;delivering&amp;nbsp;test infrastructure
        for&amp;nbsp;distributed web services. You will be part of an Engineering
        team that is working on problems related to high performance, globally distributed
        application services in the cloud. Your focus is developing code rather than
        fixing or finding bugs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twilio Software Engineers in Test
        are focused on the hardest, most interesting aspects of delivering high quality
        software. For someone who wants to learn and grow as an engineer, having access

        provides a unique opportunity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is a development role, not a traditional
        QA testing role, so not a job for manual testers. You will be embedded within
        a small, nimble engineering team, owning and operating mission critical production
        services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build automated test suites to allow
        rapid development and continuous delivery including functional, load and performance
        tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop end-to-end testers to monitor
        services from a customer perspective utilizing the Twilio APIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br

        Manager, Product Designer, Feature Inventor. at Paycor (San Francisco, CA)</title><description>Product
        Manager, Product Designer, Feature Inventor. Newton wants to talk to you!&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newton develops cloud-based, software-as-a-service applicant
        tracking software for small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;We are looking for a feature inventor! What does that mean? This role
        will reports to our Head of Products (Steve Hazelton). He is going to ask
        you to spec, product manage and build a new feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What
        is cool about this job:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a job for an inventor.
        You are perfect for this job if you like software and like building great
        things that people love. This is not a great job for someone who needs a lot
        of hand-holding and structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who
        will you work with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will report directly to
        our Head of Products. You will work with our design team (currently 1 person,
        growing) and our engineering team (about 25 people, going to 40 soon).&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you might not like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;We are not sentimental about features: if we don&amp;rsquo;t need them,
        we don&amp;rsquo;t ship them. You very well might design something that will
        never get implemented. Such is life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are a great fit for this role if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have taken business workflows / concepts and turned
        them into software, then you are perfect for this job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If
        you are good at making complicated things much simpler, then you are perfect
        for this job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri,

        discover which users are most likely to refer Grammarly to a friend).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build and publish self-serve dashboards so all functions at

        ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sellers, we&amp;rsquo;re creating
        one cohesive service to run your entire business, from a register in your
        pocket to analytics on your laptop. For buyers, we&amp;rsquo;re making it
        faster to order from the businesses you love and more fun to pay your friends
        back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying and selling sound like simple things&amp;mdash;and
        they should be. Somewhere along the way, they got complicated. We&amp;rsquo;re

        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We''re a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage

        to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
        type of problems we''re tackling involve workflow, product design, and data.
        Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good
        authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in
        multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design
        is our guiding light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snapdocs&amp;rsquo; culture

        our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent
        work as well as seeking collaboration. We''re becoming ubiquitous in one segment

        &amp;nbsp;Twilio is therefore challenged with abstracting away a world of
        complexity so that our customers can go global without concern for managing
        a global communications network, carrier integrations and relationships throughout

        a complex distributed platform with points of presence globally and will be
        concerned with availability, throughput, latency, media fidelity as well as
        real-time considerations. There will be a significant data component so you
        will be working with distributed SQL and NoSQL databases and caches. &amp;nbsp;At
        the core are cloud technologies that enable deployment and management of computing

        tracking software for small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;We are looking for a feature inventor! What does that mean? This role
        will reports to our Head of Products (Steve Hazelton). He is going to ask
        you to spec, product manage and build a new feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What
        is cool about this job:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a job for an inventor.
        You are perfect for this job if you like software and like building great
        things that people love. This is not a great job for someone who needs a lot
        of hand-holding and structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who

        /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you might not like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;We are not sentimental about features: if we don&amp;rsquo;t need them,
        we don&amp;rsquo;t ship them. You very well might design something that will
        never get implemented. Such is life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You
        are a great fit for this role if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br

        them into software, then you are perfect for this job.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If

        Engineer at Keen IO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen IO is
        seeking engineers to join our Platform team. &amp;nbsp;We build and nurture
        an Analytics API that processes user data and queries around the clock, across
        diverse industries. &amp;nbsp;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s gaming, e-commerce, advertising,
        publishing, or IoT, our platform makes analytics easy for developers so they
        can focus entirely on their core product. &amp;nbsp;Every day, every week,
        every month our challenge is to scale with a constantly growing data deluge
        and evolve along with our user&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About
        the Platform Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hail from
        diverse backgrounds. Many of us followed non-traditional paths. &amp;nbsp;Our
        current platform is built using Python, Scala and Java, and on top of Tornado,
        Kafka, Storm, Cassandra, Zookeeper, Vagrant and more. If you have lots of
        war stories, we&amp;rsquo;re eager to learn from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
        work together in a pretty novel fashion - servant leaders are elected from
        the team, by the team. Responsibilities normally held by a single manager
        are separated across multiple roles. We have very open discussions about our
        shared priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always iterating
        on how we work and what we build. We&amp;rsquo;re growing fast and we know
        that what worked a year ago won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily work a year from now.
        This applies both to the technology and the organizations of our teams. We
        want to provide the best analytics experience for developers and co-create
        the best work environment for each other - willingness to evolve is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By
        centralizing a data pipeline for hundreds of companies, we operate at a scale
        that none of them have to worry about. Looking to the horizon, we need to
        look at every piece of our infrastructure with a critical eye. &amp;nbsp;We
        need to stay ahead of the curve. &amp;nbsp;You will help us be thoughtful
        and deliberate about tackling the right bottlenecks at the right time. &amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;ll
        help make working on the platform easier and easier. &amp;nbsp;Most importantly,
        you&amp;rsquo;ll collaborate with some pretty amazing humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be
        responsible for the storage and management of a large and growing event dataset&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design and implement improved database and system level monitoring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote knowledge sharing around storage and databases within
        the company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deploying capacity and managing production events should be
        easy and predictable. &amp;nbsp;Building solid automation makes sure this
        is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a passion for working with

        Stack JavaScript Developer at A Different Engine LLC (San Francisco, CA) (allows
        remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A Different Engine is looking for a Javascript
        Engineer full-stack developer who will work with our design and development
        teams in building frontend applications, tools and content management systems
        focused on ReactJS, Angular and the NodeJS and express stacks Candidates should
        be expert JavaScript developers comfortable with advanced JavaScript concepts.
        Day to day responsibilities will be as primary developer and technical lead
        on either React, Angular or NodeJS content management tools and projects.
        Ideal candidates should be able to architect and build large scale, JavaScript
        applications based on standard frontend Javascript tools and libraries and
        comfortable using build tools such as gulp, grunt, requirejs, or browserify.
        Some of our most recent applications have been written in ES6 using gulp,
        babel and browserify. As we expand as a team we are also adding automated
        testing to many of our tools and projects using tools such as Cucumber and
        Karma so experience with JavaScript BDD/TDD tools is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates should also be comfortable with other front-end web
        technologies and tools such as HTML, CSS and tooling such as SASS or LESS
        (we use SASS mostly)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a client facing
        organization so candidates should also be comfortable speaking directly with
        outside clients as well as internal design teams, producers and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Different Engine is looking for software craftsmen who take
        the vision from our design team and turns it into a reality for our clients.
        We are looking for folks comfortable across a variety of languages, platforms
        and frameworks, and can code, and get things done regardless of language.
        Our primary development work is done in JavaScript however we frequently need
        to build quick and dirty tools for our clients to host, or their existing
        CMS (Drupal a lot) so PHP is frequently used however we also have an affinity
        for frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, and NodeJS/Express when we can choose
        the full stack. Our projects generally are 3-6 month development projects
        and we maintain internal tools and frameworks to ease and speed development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are an interactive agency, who design and build bespoke applications
        for our clients. Unfortunately this frequently forces us into more of a "Waterfall"
        development methodology. We''re trying to address this by using Agile and
        iterative methodologies as much as possible. From a management perspective
        we''re looking for folks who have experience with using and adapting agile
        practices to less than agile projects so we''re looking for candidates familiar
        with agile processes but able to adapt to our project realities.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat,

        them. We pride ourselves in providing top-notch support and guidance, so being

        Data Science Engineer (US Based) at AdRoll (San Francisco, CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The
        Data Science Engineering team writes the math and software that sit at the
        heart of AdRoll&amp;rsquo;s real-time bidding technology, our core product.
        &amp;nbsp;Our software runs over hundreds of terabytes of data daily to produce
        its models, which are then subsequently queried billions of times by hundreds
        of servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current members of Data Science
        Engineering have a passion for not only mathematics, but also technology.
        If you join our team, you will have the opportunity to stay on the cutting
        edge of research and then to put this research to practical use by building
        your own software and infrastructure systems. When you push out your code,
        you will be able to see the results of your efforts ripple throughout our
        systems in real-time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, AdRoll Engineering is broken
        out into small teams that have significant autonomy. We like to think of Data
        Science Engineering as a "startup within AdRoll." You will design your systems
        as you see fit, own your code, and your work will have a very direct, measurable
        impact on AdRoll''s core metrics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the
        Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data Science Engineering is a small
        team with a variety of concurrent projects. Your interests dictate what projects
        you will tackle. The common thread among all projects is that they require
        a high level of mathematical sophistication and engineering prowess, due to
        the scale of our data. Current projects include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhancing our machine learning software
        with the latest in machine learning algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employing
        machine learning and statistical modeling over our petabytes of data to generate
        new features to feed into our bid-time predictions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating
        systems that monitor inputs and performance on a real-time basis to inform
        engineers when unexpected changes arise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performing
        automated market analyses to dynamically react to changing market conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br

        role, working with a small team of engineers and users from various backgrounds.
        You will be expected to wear many hats. &amp;nbsp;This will include, but is
        not limited to, owning and improving our Python based distributed ML model
        building system, building and improving our Java based backend services, building
        and improving our cloud management system and developing pieces of our next
        generation user interface. &amp;nbsp;We have been developing this platform
        for more than 10 years, so the large, complex codebase requires regular maintenance
        at all layers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our
        Technology Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At
        the base of our stack is a proprietary distributed computational platform,
        which allows us to process many millions of virtual molecules at scale. We
        typically host this platform on Amazon Web Services infrastructure, where
        we often parallelize our computations across more than 10,000 cores. At the
        next layer of our stack are custom services and libraries, such as machine
        learning, cheminformatics and bioinformatics. At the very top of our stack
        sits a number of user-facing tools, including web-based GUIs, *NIX command
        line tools, and custom plugins for third party data analysis and chemistry
        tools. All of the layers use various storage types (MySQL, S3, Cassandra,
        Couchbase, custom built). The code base is mostly written in Java and Python.
        All of these layers are being actively developed and improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our software is used by our in-house scientists
        and industry partners. The demands on our software are very high, so we employ
        current best practices for development, such as continuous integration, unit
        and performance testing, agile/scrum methodologies, code reviews, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed,

        Developer - MySQL Team - Cloud Foundry at Pivotal Cloud Foundry (San Francisco,
        CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At Pivotal we&amp;rsquo;re building
        a platform to change the way the world builds software. A huge part of this
        is changing the way that operators deploy and developers consume data services.
        We believe that in the future developers will ask for a database by calling
        an API, not by filing a ticket and waiting for it to be provisioned for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our MySQL team develops the service which provides on demand
        databases and manages their entire lifecycle. In order for developers and
        operators to trust us with their data we have to automate running services
        better than a human operator. Provisioning, backing up, restoring, scaling,
        upgrading and migrating schemas are all things we aim to make easy and seamless
        for our users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know mysql like the back of your hand. You&amp;rsquo;ve
        run production databases at scale, where uptime and consistency were of prime
        importance. You can debug slow queries in your sleep. You understand the tradeoffs
        between synchronous and asynchronous replication. The thought of cross data
        center replication fills you with excitement, not dread. High availability
        isn&amp;rsquo;t a buzzword, it&amp;rsquo;s a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a database expert, but you&amp;rsquo;re also interested
        in writing code. You&amp;rsquo;ve been a software developer, or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve
        written scripts to solve your own problems and are interested in learning
        more. In the past you might have been a DBA, a systems administrator, an SRE,
        or a software developer. Today, you&amp;rsquo;re interested in doing all of
        these at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You judge your success
        by the success of your team; you are interested in automation; and you are
        excited to work with and on open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are opinionated about how software should be
        built. Engineers pair program, all-day every-day, because we know it delivers
        remarkable results. We work in small teams in a large open team room. We believe
        in working at a sustainable pace &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll typically work
        hard for 8 hours each day, but then you&amp;rsquo;re off work to relax, recharge,
        and refocus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016

        team health. We are a high-touch, collaborative team, and you will be expected
        be an aggressive steward of the culture, providing room for individuals to
        take risks and sometimes fail while not compromising the integrity or availability
        of our systems. "Firm but fair" is sort of corny but that''s what you will
        be. You''ll be courageous too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This position
        is in our San Francisco office in SOMA, but the team is distributed, with
        presence in all the lower-48 timezones. The ideal candidate will have management
        experience in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our technology
        stack is modern and always changing, but we are thoughtful and deliberate
        about bringing new technologies. Currently most of our services are fat-JAR
        Scala deployments to Chef-configured&amp;nbsp;Ubuntu''s that end up directly
        on AWS or on Mesos, with lots of RabbitMQ traffic between them, backed by
        MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Postgres, and you should be comfortable in that sort
        of environment, using Python to automate everything you can. Or Ruby if you
        have to.&amp;nbsp;Where we can, we make decisions based on data, and the ideal
        candidate would know how to use tools such as Librato and Splunk to get a
        global understanding of the system but also be able to get down and dirty
        in the shell on individual machines. On-call rotation is part of the role,
        as you might expect, but we work hard to make that not suck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we manage health-care data, we must comply with HIPAA
        and related laws, and good decision-making and data-defensive thinking are
        critical for our team members.&amp;nbsp;We are especially interested in candidates
        who have DBA experience with a relational or NoSQL database and/or who have
        worked in a HITRUST-guided or regulated environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our
        culture is important to us and we cultivate it carefully. We do not strive
        for heroism and while we recognize and reward individual accomplishments,
        we know that ultimately, teams win. Most of our projects are paired work and
        several of our team members are embedded in development teams.&amp;nbsp;I
        almost wrote this whole job posting without saying DevOps. Oh well! Yeah,
        we do that too, whatever it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
        addition to a typical startup benefit package, we offer free health care for
        individuals (families prorated and highly discounted), catered lunches every
        day and snacks, unlimited PTO, and competitive compensation including stock
        options.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 17:28:43 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-03-08T17:28:43Z</a10:updated><location

        ADMIN ENGINEER (CISCO MANDATORY, OPENSTACK A PLUS) at IDenTV, LLC (San Francisco,
        CA) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As an engineer or potentially
        the leader of the IDenTV DevOps team, there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to the impact
        you can have on the business. All of our engineering teams are responsible
        for deploying and supporting their own services, and because of this they
        look to us for advice, guidance, and stability. We invest heavily in infrastructure
        because we know that engineers are happiest when they&amp;rsquo;re shipping
        code. Our current MVP deployment has been deemed in the top 10% of ALL Open-Stack
        deployments in 2015 and we have plans to expand and ASAP!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
        We believe in picking the right tools for the job, whether that means evaluating
        the current networking, third party vendors or preparing schematics for colocation
        and building something in house. We aren&amp;rsquo;t dogmatic about technologies
        and we adapt our systems based on the needs of the organization. Currently
        you&amp;rsquo;ll find us writing Python and using a suite of Amazon Web Services,
        Jenkins, Splunk, Docker, and Graphite, just to name a few.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a FAMILY business with FAMILY values and although we
        want to trust all humanity we have had a few bad apples, however if you show
        the loyalty and commitment your growth can be unlimited - this would be entering
        a high impact team from the 1st floor of the proverbial ground floor of the
        Company (work to become core team member and long-term can build to earn options
        and more!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;**WE WILL CONSIDER REMOTE WORK IF

        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have an insatiable craving for making applications more
        consistent and reliable over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You believe
        you can automate everything, and you can identify opportunities to remove
        manual processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You understand scalable
        web architectures and have implemented a few.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You

        Reliability Engineer - Edge Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fastly
        is looking for an experienced Software Engineer or Systems Administrator to
        join our site reliability&amp;nbsp;engineering team. Strong candidates will
        possess a mix of prior experience in software engineering and systems administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site reliability&amp;nbsp;engineering team is responsible
        for the &amp;ldquo;operating platform&amp;rdquo; of our CDN; from server selection
        and evaluation, to kernels and drivers, varnish, haproxy, and monitoring;
        the team drives architecture, design, and implementation at each layer of
        the stack. The team contributes to uptime, availability, and performance related
        goals. While the team uses traditional system administration techniques to
        debug and understand problems, we use our talents to write software to reduce
        problems at scale. Platform engineering partners closely with teams that drive
        development on our software defined networking (SDN) stack and Varnish-based
        cache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be comfortable working in
        a non-cloud environment, possessing knowledge of how to build and manage distributed
        systems that run on bare metal hardware. Knowledge of PXE, TFTP, and bootstrapping
        is must. You should be comfortable with Chef. You should be able to explain
        the benefits and downsides of TCP Segment Offload and why userland upstreaming
        processes for security patches are good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun,

        Network Administrator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar&amp;rsquo;s Network &amp;amp; Server Admin group is a
        small team of Systems Administrators who are responsible for all aspects of
        the studio&amp;rsquo;s network, server and core infrastructure. We work tirelessly
        behind the scenes to ensure that all systems and services the Studio relies
        on to create our movies are fully operational with ample room to grow. From
        DNS to NTP to BGP (we really know our TLAs!), we are constantly looking for
        new ways to stay ahead of the curve. We are looking for someone to join our
        team as a network-centric Senior Network/Sysadmin who is nimble, has a positive
        attitude, and works well as part of a small team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar
        is a dynamic, fast-paced environment and our group thrives on creative thinking,
        independent initiative, and close collaboration. We interface primarily with
        other groups within the Systems Department, and the Studio Tools Department,
        building everything from physical servers to virtual machines to racks to
        cloud services. We are always looking for new ways to automate processes and
        make optimal use of the myriad of data sources flowing from our systems and
        networks. A given problem might entail writing Python or shell scripts, digging
        into a vendor&amp;rsquo;s API documentation, or trawling through an SNMP MIB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the stuff we work with every day, in no particular order:
        Linux/UNIX, DNS, DHCP, Firewalls, AAA servers, Mail servers/appliances, load
        balancers, routers, switches, wireless LANs, WAN connectivity, and fiber optic
        networking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 01:35:21 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2016-03-03T01:35:21Z</a10:updated><location

        server-side developer at Ahrefs Research (San Francisco, CA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Ahrefs
        Research is looking for backend developer with deep understanding of operating
        systems, networks and taste for simple and efficient architectural designs.
        Our backend is implemented mostly in OCaml and some C++, as such proficiency
        in OCaml is very much appreciated, otherwise a strong inclination to intensively
        learn OCaml in a short term will be required. Understanding of functional
        programming in general and/or experience with other FP languages (F#,Haskell,Scala,Scheme,etc)
        will help a lot. Knowledge of C++ is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The
        ideal candidate is expected to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Independently
        deal with and investigate bugs, schedule tasks and dig code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make argumented technical choice and take responsibility for
        it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the whole technology stack at
        all levels : from network and userspace code to OS internals and hardware&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handle full development cycle of a single component, i.e. formalize
        task, write code and tests, setup and support production (devops)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approach problems with practical mindset and suppress perfectionism
        when time is a priority&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These
        requirements stem naturally from our approach to development with fast feedback
        cycle, highly-focused personal areas of responsibility and strong tendency
        to vertical component splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Feb

        is an organization that is growing and scaling at an inspiring pace. Our goal
        is to enlighten other web businesses to do the same. We provide databases
        as a service to the development world. If you have experience with building
        out useful and fluid infrastructure for high capacity/bandwidth systems, we
        have a premier offer for you. You''ll spend your day-to-day working in an
        industry bubbling with potential, applying interesting and fun tools, while
        being supported by a talented and close-knit team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If
        you''d love sitting at the helm of a beautiful, interconnected distributed
        system, we think you''d have a blast with our team. This is an important role.
        There''ll be lots of places to focus your attention. You''ll assist our engineers
        and support staff internally while maintaining and building out our systems.
        We have a sane on-call schedule that we share between the Operation, Engineer
        and Support teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can speak fluently,
        amiably, and comfortably to both modern web infrastructure and human-beings,
        we have a wonderful team that would like to grow with you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know this is a different process than you''re used to, but
        it''s all part of an effort to minimize our own biases as much as possible.
        If you''re the best person for the job, we want to take away all our human
        filters and allow you to show it. We respect a fancy education or a list of
        spectacular previous accomplishments, but nothing is more impressive than
        the right combination of ingredients - which you can objectively demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that a complex introductory work sample is a big

        Developer at Compose (San Mateo, CA) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In
        the present world of application development it''s difficult to determine
        where the front-end stops and the back-end begins. While we don''t feel wise
        enough to define where this point may be, we feel the right candidate will
        be adventurous enough to focus more on how to provide the strongest and cleanest
        user experience. We''re seeking someone familiar with Rails and JavaScript
        who is interested in creating beautiful and functional work. Compose will
        lead you to opportunities to learn and grow, while providing excellent conventions
        (like our internal framework Megatron) to comfortably work within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an Application Developer with Compose, you''ll make major
        contributions to the design, function and user experience of our product.
        You will join a talented and supportive team in a self-managing and open organization.
        We''re remote first and have a diverse group of friendly people located all
        over the world. We''ll give you the respect, freedom, and trust to contribute
        your talents in a way that you envision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With
        great respect/freedom/trust comes great responsibility, and as such it will
        be crucial that you have the right intrinsic motivators to work with little
        direction and oversight but still collaborate and seek alternative view-points.
        If you love making beautiful and functional things and want to have some fun,
        we''d love to see what you can cook up for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think
        you''re a match?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compose implements
        blind-hiring! Merit based, objectively graded work samples are the first step.
        We have worked hard to minimize our own biases as much as possible and find
        the best possible humans for the team. We respect a fancy education or a list
        of spectacular previous accomplishments, but nothing is more impressive than
        the right combination of ingredients - which you can objectively demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br

        software appeals to those who love to solve puzzles and apply their creative
        energy -- and also to those, in our experience, who like working from home
        in their pyjamas. It is often said that one of the trickiest accomplishments
        in the development world is imagining, building and maintaining a complex
        and interconnected mental model of your entire infrastructure within your
        working memory. If you have experience applying this mental feat within some
        type of Software-as-a-Service and want to grow into something new, we have
        a tremendous challenge for you and a terrific team willing and able to support
        you through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need crafty humans to help
        expand the Compose vision. Compose has grown into a vibrant work environment
        where folks can feel comfortable being themselves, living a balanced life.
        We welcome you to enjoy comfort when taking risks, collaborate with spirited
        peers, and to unleash your creative personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think
